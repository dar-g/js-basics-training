        <h1>Calculate Queue Time</h1>
        <p>
            There is a queue for the self-checkout tills at the supermarket. Your task is write a function to calculate the total time required for all the customers to check out! Input: customers - an array of positive integers representing the queue (Each integer represents a customer, and its value is the amount of time they require to check out), n: a positive integer, the number of checkout tills. Output: The function should return an integer, the total time required.
        </p>
        <p>
            ### EXAMPLE - queueTime([5,3,4], 1) // should return 12, because when there is 1 till, the total time is just the sum of the times
        </p>
    </main>
    <script>
        function calcQueueTime (arr, numOfTills) {
            let customerTime = 0;

            for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
                customerTime += arr[i];
            }

            return customerTime / numOfTills;
        }

        let arrOne = [3, 6, 9];
    </script>
